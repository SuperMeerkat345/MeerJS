# MeerJS
Note: this library is in development and it is mostly me learning how to make a JS library, check https://www.npmjs.com/package/meerjs for import.

A JS library that optimizes javascript and fixes any annoyences that I have with this language.

Current functions:
print(input); -- this command has the same function as console.log();

wholeTest(n); -- Tests if the number is whole, returns true if it is
undefinedTest(n); -- Tests if a variable is undefined

Counter class:
    new Counter(counting(true/false), countingInterval(int), startPoint(int), endPoint(int), printVals(True/False), runFunction(Function), runFunctionInterval(int));
    Counter.start(); // starts the actual counting
